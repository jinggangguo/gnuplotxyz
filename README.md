# GNUPLOTXYZ.GMS 

A Windows based GAMS Interface to GNUPLOT

Uwe A. Schneider

Gnuplotxyz.gms allows users to plot data from GAMS runs in GNUPLOT. 

Gnuplotxyz.gms is user friendly as only one single line is needed to produce a plot. Nevertheless, many of the default options can be changed by using [optional statements](https://github.com/uwe-schneider/gnuplotxyz/wiki/Home/#options) as illustrated below. In addition, one can modify the gnuplotxyz.gms file for personal needs and preferences.
